            <h4>Top 20 Foods High In Antioxidants</h4>
            <p>
              Antioxidants remove free radicals from the
              body which can run rampant and actually damage cells, causing
              serious illness. Many health professionals use them for treatments
              of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and
              Parkinson's.
